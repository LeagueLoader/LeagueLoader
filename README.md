## About

**League Loader** is a **plugin loader** designed specifically for the **League of Legends Client** (League Client).

The League Client is actually an embedded Chromium web browser, and its interface is based on web technology. With League Loader, users can load JavaScript plugins into the Client as dependencies, allowing them to customize/theme the UI/UX, automate task and build a smarter Client.

League Loader was created to solve the problem caused by the big LoL patch in 2021, revived plugins from the death of Mecha. And now, Mecha has since returned as a debugger, but League Loader continues to thrive as the primary way for players looking to enhance their League Client with custom content, smarter functionality, and a personalized look and feel.

## Features
- Customize League Client with plugins
- Theme/personalize your Client
- Support modern JavaScript features
- Support built-in and remote DevTools
- Working with LCU APIs with ease

</p>

Notes:
- Windows 7 is not tested, but it requires .Net Framework 4.5+ installed to run
- With Windows 8.1/10 clean install, you need to install [VC++ 2013](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)
- Do not put your League Loader folder into 'League of Legends' or 'Riot Client' folder
- Before remnoving the portable version, you have to deactivate it

> To try preview features, you should [build this project](#build-from-source) or download the newest auto-build in [Actions](https://github.com/nomi-san/league-loader/actions).

## JavaScript plugins

Plugin development requires basic knowledge of [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and [**CSS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) if you want to make a theme. That's pretty easy if you already know web programming.

To make your first plugin, just create a new folder in the `plugins` folder and name it to your plugin name, e.g `your-plugin`. Then create a new file with name `index.js` in your plugin folder.

```
plugins/
  |__your-plugin/
    |__index.js
```

This `index.js` is an entry point of your plugin and will be executed when League Client ready. Put this line to your index, you will see the log in console.

```js
console.log('Hello, League Client!')
```

#### ðŸ‘‰ Please check out these [basic plugin templates](./plugins) to start.

> We recommend you to use modern JavaScript editors like **Visual Studio Code** or **WebStorm** to develop your plugins, it supports intellisense, linter and code autocompletion. All your code/text files should be saved as UTF-8 encoding (no BOM).

### Module system

> League Loader supports fully ES6+ features, including ES module system. Now this ESM becomes the official [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).

To load other scripts, just use `import`:

```
plugins/
  |__your-plugin/
    |__index.js
    |__utils.js
```

```js
// utils.js
export default {
  greet: () => console.log('Hello!')
}

// index.js
import utils from './utils'
utils.greet();
```

> To use `import` and `export` properly, please refer this [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import).

Top-level await:
```js
let data = await fetch('https://...').then(res => res.text()); 
```

Import a ESM library from CDN:
```js
import axios from 'https://esm.run/axios';
axios.get('https://...');
```

Assets import:

```js
import './theme.css';
// auto-inject CSS

import data from './data.json';
// parsed JSON data

import bgImage from './assets/background.png';
// path to asset
```

Explicit import:
```js
import QuantifyFontUrl from './assets/Quantify.ttf?url';
// https://plugins/your-plugin/assets/Quantify.ttf

import rawData from './my-data.txt?raw';
// content of my-data.txt in string
```

> With `?raw`, your text files must be saved with UTF8 encoding.

### Theme the League Client

Inject custom CSS to override default League's style.

From your plugin entry, use import to add:

```js
import './theme.css';
```

This line will inject CSS code from `theme.css` next to your `index.js`.

To use remote theme, e.g from `https://example.com/theme.css`:

```js
function addCssLink(url) {
  const link = document.createElement('link');
  link.href = url;
  link.type = 'text/css';
  link.rel = 'stylesheet';
  document.head.appendChild(link);
}

window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  addCssLink('https://example.com/theme.css');
});
```

### LCU API requests

Just use `fetch` to make LCU requests:
```js
async function acceptMatchFound() {
  await fetch('/lol-matchmaking/v1/ready-check/accept', {
    method: 'POST'  
  });
}
```

### LCU WebSocket

When the websocket ready, this link tag will appear:
```html
<link rel="riot:plugins:websocket" href="wss://riot:abcDEF0123XYZ@127.0.0.1:12345/">
```

Call this function to subscribe API event:
```js
function subscribe() {
  const uri = document.querySelector('link[rel="riot:plugins:websocket"]').href
  const ws = new WebSocket(uri, 'wamp')
  
  ws.onopen = () => ws.send(JSON.stringify([5, 'OnJsonApiEvent']))
  ws.onmessage = async message => {
    const data = JSON.parse(message.data)
    console.log(data)
    // ...
  }
}
```

### NodeJS & npm compatibility

We highly recommend you to use npm project for building plugins. With TypeScript or other languages require transpilation, you need a build tool to build them,
Webpack, Rollup or Vite is the best choice.

You can also use any front-end library to build custom UI, e.g React, Preact, Vue, Svelte, SolidJS, etc. With front-end tooling, its hot-reload/HMR will help you to do faster.

Example plugins:
- [./plugins/@default](./plugins/@default): Vite with SolidJS + SASS + TypeScript
- [douugdev/league-a-better-client](https://github.com/douugdev/league-a-better-client): Webpack with Preact + SASS + TypeScript

> Please note that all packages that are designed to run in NodeJS only could not be used for League Loader plugin.

> With build tool, your bundled assets output may have incorrect path. Please refer to next section to make them right.

### Accessing local resources

You can access local resources in **assets** and **plugins** folder by using these domain:

```
//assets/
//plugins/
```

They are also equivalent to `https://assets/` and `https://plugins` (HTTPS based scheme).

```
root/
  |__assets/
    |__background.png      ->  //assets/background.png
  |__plugins/
    |__your-plugin/
      |__assets/
        |__some-image.jpg  ->  //plugins/your-plugin/assets/some-image.jpg
```

- **assets** folder contains common resources.
- While assets in **plugins** folder are used for plugin itself.
