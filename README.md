## About

**League Loader** is a **plugin loader** designed specifically for the **League of Legends Client** (League Client).

The League Client is actually an embedded Chromium web browser, and its interface is based on web technology. With League Loader, users can load JavaScript plugins into the Client as dependencies, allowing them to customize/theme the UI/UX, automate tasks, and build a smarter Client.

League Loader was created to solve the problem caused by the big LoL patch in 2021, which resurrected plugins from the death of Mecha. And now, Mecha has since returned as a debugger, but League Loader continues to thrive as the primary way for players looking to enhance their League Client with custom content, smarter functionality, and a personalized look and feel.

## Features
- Customize League Client with plugins
- Theme/personalize your Client
- Support modern JavaScript features
- Support for built-in and remote DevTools
- Work with LCU APIs with ease

## Getting started

</p>

Troubleshooting:
- Windows 7 is not tested, but requires .Net Framework 4.5+ installed to run
- For Windows 8.1/10 clean install, you should install [VC++ 2013](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)
- Do not put your League Loader folder in the 'League of Legends' or 'Riot Client' folder
- Before removing the portable version, you must first deactivate it

> To try out the preview features, you should [build this project](#build-from-source) or download the latest auto-build in [Actions](https://github.com/nomi-san/league-loader/actions).

## JavaScript plugins

Plugin development requires basic knowledge of [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), and [**CSS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) if you want to make a theme. It's pretty easy if you're already familiar with web programming.

To create your first plugin, simply create a new folder in the `plugins` folder and name it with the name of your plugin, e.g. `your-plugin`. Then create a new file called `index.js` in your plugins folder.

```
plugins/
  |__your-plugin/
    |__index.js
```

This `index.js` is an entry point for your plugin and will be executed when the League Client is ready. Add this line to your `index.js`, you will see the log in console.

```js
console.log('Hello, League Client!')
```

#### ðŸ‘‰ Please check out these [Basic plugin templates](./plugins) to get started.

> We recommend that you use modern JavaScript editors like Visual Studio Code or WebStorm to develop your plugins, it supports intellisense, linter and code auto-completion. All your code/text files should be saved in UTF-8 encoding (no BOM).

### Module system

> League Loader supports fully ES6+ features, including ES module system. Now this ESM becomes the official [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).

To load other scripts, just use `import`:

```
plugins/
  |__your-plugin/
    |__index.js
    |__utils.js
```

```js
// utils.js
export default {
  greet: () => console.log('Hello!')
}

// index.js
import utils from './utils'
utils.greet();
```

> To use `import` and `export` properly, please refer this [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import).

Top-level await:
```js
let data = await fetch('https://...').then(res => res.text()); 
```

Import a ESM library from CDN:
```js
import axios from 'https://esm.run/axios';
axios.get('https://...');
```

Assets import:

```js
import './theme.css';
// auto-inject CSS

import data from './data.json';
// parsed JSON data

import bgImage from './assets/background.png';
// path to asset
```

Explicit import:
```js
import QuantifyFontUrl from './assets/Quantify.ttf?url';
// https://plugins/your-plugin/assets/Quantify.ttf

import rawData from './my-data.txt?raw';
// content of my-data.txt in string
```

> With `?raw`, your text files must be saved in UTF8 encoding.

### Theme the League Client

Adding custom CSS helps you to override default the League style.

From your plugin entry, use `import` to add it:

```js
import './theme.css';
```

This line will append a link tag to body pointing to `theme.css` next to your `index.js`.

To use remote theme, e.g from `https://example.com/theme.css`:

```js
function addCssLink(url) {
  const link = document.createElement('link');
  link.href = url;
  link.type = 'text/css';
  link.rel = 'stylesheet';
  document.head.appendChild(link);
}

window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  addCssLink('https://example.com/theme.css');
});
```

### LCU API requests

Just use `fetch` to make LCU requests:
```js
function acceptMatchFound() {
  fetch('/lol-matchmaking/v1/ready-check/accept', {
    method: 'POST'  
  });
}
```

Note that `fetch` returns a Promise for async context, you should wrap it in inside an async function.
```js
async function getSummonerName() {
  const res = await fetch('/lol-summoner/v1/current-summoner');
  const data = await res.json();
  return data['displayName'];
}
```

For LCDS (RTMP) calls, you can use `URLSearchParams` and `JSON.strigify` to construct call parameters.
```js
async function quitLobby() {    // never know why people call it 'dodge'
  const params = new URLSearchParams({
    destination: 'lcdsServiceProxy',
    method: 'call',
    args: JSON.stringify(['', 'teambuilder-draft', 'quitV2', ''])
  });
  const url = '/lol-login/v1/session/invoke?' + params.toString();
  await fetch(url, { method: 'POST' });
}
```

### LCU WebSocket

When the websocket ready, this link tag will appear:
```html
<link rel="riot:plugins:websocket" href="wss://riot:abcDEF0123XYZ@127.0.0.1:12345/">
```

Call this function to subscribe API event:
```js
function subscribe() {
  const uri = document.querySelector('link[rel="riot:plugins:websocket"]').href
  const ws = new WebSocket(uri, 'wamp')
  
  ws.onopen = () => ws.send(JSON.stringify([5, 'OnJsonApiEvent']))
  ws.onmessage = async message => {
    const data = JSON.parse(message.data)
    console.log(data)
    // ...
  }
}
```

### NodeJS & npm compatibility

We strongly recommend that you to use npm project to build plugins. With TypeScript or other languages that require transpilation, you need a build tool to build them,
Webpack, Rollup or Vite is the best choice.

You can also use any front-end library to build custom UI, e.g. React, Preact, Vue, Svelte, SolidJS, etc. With front-end tooling, its hot-reload/HMR will help you to do faster.

Example plugins:
- [/plugins/vite-theme](./plugins/vite-theme) - A simple theme with Vite âš¡ HMR + SASS + TypeScript
- [/plugins/@default](./plugins/@default) - Vite âš¡ HMR + SolidJS + SASS + TypeScript
- [douugdev/league-a-better-client](https://github.com/douugdev/league-a-better-client) - Webpack âš¡ HMR + âš› Preact + SASS + TypeScript

> Please note that all packages that are designed to run only in NodeJS cannot be used for League Loader plugin.

> With the build tool, the output of your bundled assets output may have incorrect paths. Please refer to next the section to make correct them.

### Accessing local resources

You can access local resources in **assets** and **plugins** folder by using these domain:

```
//assets/
//plugins/
```

They are also equivalent to `https://assets/` and `https://plugins` (HTTPS based scheme).

```
root/
  |__assets/
    |__background.png      ->  //assets/background.png
  |__plugins/
    |__your-plugin/
      |__assets/
        |__some-image.jpg  ->  //plugins/your-plugin/assets/some-image.jpg
```

- **assets** folder contains common resources.
- While assets in **plugins** folder are used for plugin itself.
